  title: Intellector WebSocket API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    This API is in charge of any event-driven interaction with the Intellector server (that is, anything that cannot be achieved via REST endpoints).

    Primary uses: online status check, notifications, in-game events.

    Any message sent by a client must be a valid JSON having the following structure:
    ```
    {
      "event": "name_of_the_event",
      "token": "authorization_token",
      "body": {...event payload conforming to the respective schema...}
    }
    ```

    Structure of the server-sent events is analogous:
    ```
    {
      "event": "name_of_the_event",
      "body": {...event payload conforming to the respective schema...}
    }
    ```

    Valid client- and server-sent event names and their corresponding payload schemas are presented later in this specification.

    Authorization token is obtained using the REST API /auth endpoints (there are one for guest authorization and one for logging in).
